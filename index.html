            <p>15-20% of the population perceive and feel differently. They are more aware of subtleties
                but are also more easily overwhelmed. They are called Highly Sensitive Persons. High
                Sensitivity is a personality trait that is not to be confused with extro-/introversion.
                Furthermore, every HSP is different. 
                This project focuses on a very small part of High Sensitivity, the perception of hearing.
                HSPs have a lower threshold of hearing but are also more easily overwhelmed by intense,
                and loud sounds. This project tries to provide a metaphor for a Highly Sensitive Person’s
                hearing. This metaphor enables non-HSPs to experience a HSP’s hearing.</p>

            2. Lui feels different. Their friends sometimes ask why the cover their ears.
            3. Lui searches online: Why are sounds so uncomfortable for me but not for others?
            4. After intense research Lui finds out about their high sensitivity.
            5. Lui wants to share how they perceive sounds with their friends.
            6. Lui finds a metaphoric soundscape showing their highly sensitive hearing.

            <h2>What this comparison can tell us</h2>
            <p>These quotes are taking from a user study of non-HSP listening to those sounds and answering this question: “How did listening to these two soundscapes change your perception of HSPs?”</p>
            <p class="quote">“[…] I guess my redefinition of Highly Sensitive would […] instead of going for “how you subjectively perceive that” [it would go for] “how you objectively perceive that”, like biologically speaking. […] So, you are the same person, but you are now listening to this in a way different way and therefore you are acting on that in a different way because it is not the same sound. […]”</p>
            <p class="quote">“[…]. If you actually feel it that way, I mean then it’s something that you have no control over. I guess […]”</p>
            <p class="quote">“The embodied feeling of it [the sounds] makes you kinda understand a little bit better as opposed to someone telling you these things.”</p>
